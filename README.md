Subscription-Based Business Churn Analysis Project
Subscription-based businesses face significant revenue loss due to customer churn, 
making retention a critical focus. The key objectives of this project are to analyze churn patterns,
identify high-risk customer segments, and develop data-driven strategies to reduce churn.
The analysis will answer critical business questions, such as identifying churn-prone customer groups, evaluating the impact of payment methods and monthly spending on churn, 
and detecting behavioral patterns that indicate cancellation risk. By leveraging Python for data cleaning and analysis, 
SQL for querying insights, and Excel for dashboard visualization,
this project will help businesses enhance customer retention, optimize pricing models, and improve long-term profitability.
